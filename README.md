Developed a Web Browser application using PyQt5, a popular Python GUI library, and integrated the QtWebEngineWidgets module to enable web browsing functionality. This application provides a user-friendly interface with a navigation toolbar, allowing users to browse the internet seamlessly. Key features include navigation buttons (Back, Forward, Reload), a home button for quick access to a predefined homepage, and a URL bar for entering website addresses. The application utilizes the QtWebEngineView widget to display web content and ensures a responsive and intuitive browsing experience. This project showcases proficiency in PyQt5, event handling, and integration of web browsing capabilities within a desktop application.
